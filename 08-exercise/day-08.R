#Practice making joins and pivots

# Make a faceted plot of the cumulative cases & 
#deaths by USA region. Your x axis should be the
# date and the y axis value/count. To do this you
# will need to join and pivot the COVID-19 data.
# We can break this task into 7 steps:

#Read in the COVID-19 Data



#Create a new data.frame using the available 
#state.abb, state.name, state.region objects in 
# base R. Be intentional about creating a primary 
#key to match to the COVID data!


# example code
#df = data.frame(region = state.region,
#                ...,
#                ...)



#Join your new data.frame to the raw COVID data.
#Think about right, inner, left, or full joinâ€¦



# split-apply the joined data to determine the daily,
# cumulative, cases and deaths for each region



# Pivot your data from wide format to long



# Plot your data in a compelling way (setup, layers,
# labels, facets, themes)



# Save the image to your img directory with a good
# file name and extension!
